 /*Rules to determine who won:
            - https://wizardofodds.com/play/baccarat/
            - Number cards Ace - 9 have point values of 1 - 9
            - If the card is a 10 or Face card, it has a point value of 0
          Steps to play:
            - User bids on either Banker, Player to win, or a Tie.
            - Dealer than Deals two cards to each Player and Banker -> Player,Banker,Player,Banker
              player always goes first
            - If the Player or Bankers hand adds up to 8 OR 9 points, its a "Natural Win"
            - Else The Player will go first:
                if hand totals to 5 or less, The Player gets one more card.
                If the hand totals to 6 or 7 points, no more cards are given.
                EX: The Player will go first: if hand totals to 5 or less, The Player gets one more
                card. If the hand totals to 6 or 7 points, no more cards are given.
            - The Banker’s turn:
            if the bankers first two cards total 7 or more, no more cards are dealt.
            If The Banker’s cards total 2 or less, The Banker gets one additional card.
            If The Bankers first two cards total 3, 4, 5, or 6, it depends on if The Player drew
            another card and if so, the value of that card to determine if The Banker receives another card.
